Working name: Vault

Vault is a staking platform that rewards long term hodlers of projects. 

It is based off the 0x167 (ghandiji) contract. This model encourages hodling by providing a revenue stream to stronger hands in the market and penalising weaker hands for withdrawing their funds. 

Base layer staking may also be implemented for coins that support this. This will provide multiple revenue streams for depositors. 

Vault is a non-custodial staking service. All admin keys will be removed from the contract before deployment. The only address capable of withdrawing funds will be the depositor of such funds. Nobody will be able to edit the code or take it down.
